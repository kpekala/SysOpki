Ooh, ooh
Across the ocean, across the sea
Startin' to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face
I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road and upside down now
I know it's hard babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
